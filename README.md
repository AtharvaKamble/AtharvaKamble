# Atharva Kamble

Hi there, I am Atharva Kamble, an experienced software engineer currently pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Software Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. ðŸ‘‹

I am a tech enthusiast, and mainly a software generalist - because of my fundamental understanding of tech and programming, it helps me to learn new frameworks and build higher-level knowledge very quickly. In my free time, I like to build meaningful projects that try to fulfill a use case.

Open to SDE roles across the US starting May '25.

# FAQ about me!
### What are you doing currently?
```
As of now it's the summer break of '24 and I am actively looking for an internship or
a co-op. My university also allows me to intern through the fall semester! In the meantime,
I spend time building projects for valid use-cases, maintaining my open source product Present,
write blogs, and increase my algorithmic skills on Leetcode.
```

### What descriptions fit you the best?
- [x] Software Development Engineer
- [x] Software Engineer
- [x] Fullstack Engineer 


### Where are you located?
```
Boston MA, the home of the Red Sox! I am available for remote or hybrid WFH, and have valid
permissions to WFO anywhere in the US though.
```
### What technologies do you specialize in?
```
I specialize in building end-to-end web products with React.js, Next.js, Typescript, GoLang, Java,
Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vercel, Git, Unix, Neovim.
```
```
Recently, while at college, I also had amazing experiences diving into the newest cutting-edge
tech like Web3 and Prompt Engineering. I deployed an NFT marketplace that hosted and minted
all NFTs on Pinata cloud IPFS. Along with we built a Bitcoin explorer as a class project where
everyone from the class contributed to a single repo by taking ownership of smaller modules for the site.
```
```
Huge shoutout to Prof. Nick Bear Brown at Northeastern University, who got me so interested
in Prompt Engineering - this stretched to engineering prompts to generate other prompts, images,
videos and songs even! I like pursuing prompt engineering in my leisure time because it allows me to
access the new age of GPT chatbots with more and more efficiency.
```

### What's one product that you are really proud of?
```
projects.athk.dev/present

This is a project that started as a semester capstone project, but due to its use case, I began
maintaining it as an open-source project. It's unique selling point is that it speeds up the process of
creating presentations for all users, and that too pretty presentations. You have to be fairly tech-savvy to
build presentations containing tons of animations and present information in a swift manner.

This app allows that, with a simpler, new approach!
```

### Are you working on anything new?
```
I am currently working on Model0 - which is a platform as a service that leverages AWS SageMaker to
allow users to build, train and fine-tune their own ML, and GPT models. The platform also aims on
providing users with API interface to use pre-trained versions of their models into their own apps.

A very good use-case: train and fine-tune the weights of a LLM or SLM on Model0, deploy it and then
communicate to it with a dedicate custom or templated API. For eg. a customer help chatbot.

I am using Next.js on the frontend and GoLang on the backend along with Terraform's Cloud Development
Kit to manage AWS infrastructure.

### Do you have a personal website? 
> Yes! Visit [https://athk.dev](https://athk.dev)

### How do I contact you?
```
I am super excited to hear from you so we can grow our network! Feel free to
reach me at kamble.ath@northeastern.edu OR my personal mail atharva.io@outlook.com
```

### Do you write? Where can I find your stuff?
```
Yes! I do like to write about technologies, my current progress and findings on Medium and on my site!

My site:                   blog.athk.dev
Find me on Medium:         medium.com/@atharvadkamble00
