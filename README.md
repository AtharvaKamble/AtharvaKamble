# Atharva Kamble

Hi there, I am Atharva Kamble, an experienced software engineer currently pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Software Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. ðŸ‘‹

I am a tech enthusiast, and mainly a software generalist - because of my fundamental understanding of tech and programming, it helps me to learn new frameworks and build higher-level knowledge very quickly. In my free time, I like to build meaningful projects that try to fulfill a use case.

Open to SDE roles across the US starting May '25.

# FAQ about me!
### What are you doing currently?
```
As of now I work as a Teaching Assistant for Prof. Nik Brown at
Northeastern University - where I assist him for CSYE 7270 - Building Virtual Environments
(LLMs, Chatbots, C++, C#)
```

### What descriptions fit you the best?
- [x] Software Development Engineer
- [x] Software Engineer
- [x] Fullstack Engineer
- [x] Data Engineer
- [x] Frontend Engineer
- [x] Backend Engineer


### Where are you located?
```
Boston MA, the home of the Red Sox! I am available for remote or hybrid WFH, and have valid
permissions to WFO anywhere in the US though.
```
### What technologies do you specialize in?
```
I specialize in building end-to-end web products with React.js, Next.js, Typescript, GoLang, Java,
Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vercel, Git, Unix, Neovim.
```

```
Huge shoutout to Prof. Nick Bear Brown at Northeastern University, who got me so interested
in Prompt Engineering & AI - this stretched to engineering prompts to generate other prompts, images,
videos and songs even! I like pursuing prompt engineering in my leisure time because it allows me to
access the new age of GPT chatbots with more and more efficiency.
```

### What's one product that you are really proud of?
```
model0

A full-stack application enabling rapid creation, fine-tuning, and deployment of large language models (LLMs)
using AWS SageMaker. Utilized Python, MySQL, React.js, and AWS EC2 to deliver a high-performance, scalable infrastructure.

The objective of the project was that, I noticed that there was a need amongst developers who wanted to deploy AI chatbots,
and ML models ASAP. But such tools were not readily available.
```

### Are you working on anything new?
```
I am currently working on Model0 - which is a platform as a service that leverages AWS SageMaker to
allow users to build, train and fine-tune their own ML, and GPT models. The platform also aims on
providing users with API interface to use pre-trained versions of their models into their own apps.

A very good use-case: train and fine-tune the weights of a LLM or SLM on Model0, deploy it and then
communicate to it with a dedicate custom or templated API. For eg. a customer help chatbot.

I am using Next.js on the frontend and GoLang on the backend along with Terraform's Cloud Development
Kit to manage AWS infrastructure.
